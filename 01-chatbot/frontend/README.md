# Johann: A Chatbot to Analyze Texts on Project Gutenberg 

## Preliminaries

As long as you install these once, you won't need to worry about it again for future runs!

Please install:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)

For both tools, if you see a message asking to "add to path", please say yes. This makes sure you can easily access both tools. 

## Running the Project

Open `terminal` (if on MacOS/Linux) or `cmd` (if on Windows).

Make sure to type the following commands one after the other:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheFloatingString/ml-topics-w2026.git
cd ml-topics-w2026/01-chatbot/frontend
```

Next, in the `frontend` folder, you **must** create a file called `.env.local`. Make sure to add the following content inside `.env.local`:

```bash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

where `"your-api-key-here"` is the API key you generated by [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/). 

Next, make sure to install all the project dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

You're good to go!  

Let's run Johann using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser (i.e. Google Chrome).

## Next Steps

- Can you change the system prompt?
    - *Hint:* it's in `app/api/chat/route.ts` at line 15
- Can you change the base LLM?
    - *Hint:* it's in `app/api/chat/route.ts` at line 13 (using OpenRouter models)
- Can you add more tools?
    - *Hint:* Look at `app/api/chat/tools.ts` and `app/api/chat/tool-handlers`
    - *Hint:* Can you ask an LLM or coding agent to pattern match and create new tools?
